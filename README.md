# Samuel A. Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This repository showcases my expertise in full-stack development through a comprehensive MERN stack application. Dive into my work to explore a well-structured project that demonstrates both backend and frontend capabilities.

## üöÄ Overview

This portfolio features a full-stack application built with:

- **Node.js** and **Express** for a robust backend
- **MongoDB** for efficient data management
- **React** and **Redux Toolkit** for dynamic, responsive frontend interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadCN** for sleek, modern design
- **Vite** for fast and optimized development builds
- **NodeMailer** for email handling
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure authentication
- **Cloudinary** for image and media management

The project is structured into three main parts:

- **Backend**: Handles all server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Frontend**: Displays the user-facing portfolio.
- **Dashboard**: Provides an admin panel for managing the portfolio content.
